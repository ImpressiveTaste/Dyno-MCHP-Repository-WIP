*****************************************************************
Terms and Conditions for Delivery of Hardware and appendant Soft-
ware and End User License Agreement for IXXAT Software Products  
*****************************************************************

This software license agreement (following named "Agreement") is 
a legal agreement between you and your company ("Customer") and 
HMS Industrial Networks AB ("HMS"). 
By using the software program(s) and/or components included in 
the software or hardware delivery in any type of software-package 
("Software"), Customer agrees to be bound by the terms of this 
Agreement. If Customer does not agree to the terms of this 
Agreement, Software and the accompanying items (including any 
printed materials, binders or other containers) shall be promptly
un-installed and deleted or destroyed.

I.   Delivery of Hardware and appendant Software

 § 1 Scope of Delivery

 1.1 The hardware and the appendant software shall
     operate as described in their product description 
     and more detailed in their user documentation. 
     In respect of hardware or software, which is 
     defined in the contract as third party products, 
     HMS does not warrant that these comply with the 
     product description of their manufacturers, nor 
     that they are free of other errors.
     The products shall embody all legal and other 
     provisions related to their use.

 1.2 The programs shall be delivered in a machine-
     readable format (object code). If HMS's programs 
     have interfaces for interoperability with other 
     programs, HMS shall, at Customer's request, provide 
     required information to use such interfaces, subject 
     to reimbursement of expenses. Customer may disclose 
     such information to other contractors as necessary. 

 1.3 The user documentation for the hardware and the 
     appendant programs will be delivered stored on 
     machine-readable media or as printed hardcopy.

 1.4 Until payment has been made in full, the hardware 
     and the media containing the programs shall remain 
     HMS's property and shall not be pledged nor 
     assigned as a collateral security. 

 § 2 Right to Use the Programs

 2.1 HMS grants to Customer the right to use the acquired 
     programs to the extent agreed on in the contract. 
     Customer may use the programs for its own purposes and 
     for the purposes of Customer's group of companies.

 2.2 Customer agrees to use the appendant software only in 
     combination with such hardware that HMS has declared to be 
     compatible with these programs. Use of the software with 
     products, which are in direct competition with IXXAT 
     products or services offered and advertised by HMS is 
     explicitly excluded from the right of use.

 2.4 Customer may transfer the right to use the programs in 
     machine-readable format (object code, not source 
     code) to another user, if Customer confirms to 
     discontinue the use of the programs and the new user, 
     before receiving the media, accepts in writing 
     towards HMS to take over all obligations to protect 
     the programs and to comply with the agreed 
     restrictions of the right to use. 
     An explicit exception is software, which is provided by HMS
     free of charge - whether individually or as component of 
     another product - to enable the integration of HMS hardware 
     and/or HMS software in the customer application. This 
     software may be provided by customer to other users, as long
     as customer ensures that the other user is bound to the 
     Terms and Conditions of HMS and existing copyright marks 
     shall not be altered or removed in any way. Examples for 
     such software include the IXXAT VCI, IXXAT ECI and 
     associated example applications.

 § 3 Performance

 3.1 At Customer's request, HMS shall install all products 
     at Customer's premises. In this case, Customer shall 
     timely establish the conditions for the installation 
     of the products, in particular install the local 
     network as needed. In case it is agreed in the 
     contract that HMS shall install the programs, 
     Customer shall ensure that its personnel is capable of 
     handling the programs at the moment of installation 
     at the latest. HMS recommends that Customer’s 
     personnel shall have received extended training 
     before the installation of the programs.
     HMS shall check, before starting the installation 
     of the products, whether or not the network works 
     properly. Customer shall confirm the successful 
     installation of the programs in writing. 
     Customer shall follow the instructions for 
     installation of the hardware as defined by the 
     manufacturer. At Customer's request, HMS shall 
     consult Customer how to prepare the conditions for 
     installation. 

 3.2 Customer shall be responsible for the implementation 
     of the programs, Customer shall also be responsible 
     for testing the programs under the conditions they 
     shall be used under productively, before using them 
     productively. At Customer's request, HMS shall 
     provide support (i.e. consultancy, installation 
     support, demonstration of proper installation, brief 
     or extended training) on the basis of time consumed.

 3.3 Customer shall test HMS's deliveries for defects 
     without delay in the ordinary course of business. 

 3.4 All support (including specifically installation, 
     consultancy, brief or extended training, acceptance 
     test support) shall be reimbursed separately on the 
     basis of time consumed, unless otherwise agreed.

 3.5 HMS shall name a consultant, Customer shall name a 
     representative. Both shall have the authority to 
     make the necessary decisions or shall obtain 
     authorization for them in a timely manner. HMS´s 
     consultant shall put decisions in writing. Customer’s 
     representative shall provide all required 
     information. HMS’s consultant shall contact 
     Customer’s representative as is required to ensure 
     the proper performance of the mutual obligations.

 § 4 Customer's Responsibilities for Software Protection

 4.1 Customer acknowledges that the programs and the 
     related documentation - including future versions 
     - are copyrighted, and represent confidential 
     information and trade secrets, proprietary to HMS 
     or to HMS’s supplier. Customer shall take all 
     necessary steps to prevent the misuse of the programs 
     and their related documentation.
     If programs are delivered in source-code, Customer 
     shall make them available to any third party only 
     with HMS's prior written permission. Customer’s 
     obligation shall be permanent. The permission may 
     not be unreasonably withheld, but it need not be 
     given to enable Customer to obtain maintenance from 
     a third party. 

 4.2 Customer may copy the programs only for back-up 
     purposes, for replacement or - if source-code has 
     been delivered - in order to search for defects. 
     Customer shall attach to every media containing a copy 
     of a program the same copyright and proprietary 
     notices as are attached to the media delivered by 
     HMS. Customer may make copies of the user 
     documentation for internal purposes only and only 
     to the extent which is admissible in accordance with 
     Customer´s right of use. 

II.  General Terms and Conditions

 § 5 Charges and Payments

 5.1 Prices for hardware are ex factory. Accessories, 
     such as media, signal amplifier, data cables or 
     power supply cables, are only included in the price, 
     if so stated in the contract. If HMS installs and 
     implements such equipment, this work shall be 
     charged on the basis of time consumed.

 5.2 HMS is entitled to change it's prices at it sole discretion
     at any time.

 5.3 In as far as it is agreed to remunerate HMS on the 
     basis of time consumed, hourly rates, travel 
     expenses and incidental expenses shall be paid in 
     accordance with HMS's current standard rates 
     (price list), unless other rates are agreed on.

 5.4 Payments for the products shall be billed after the 
     installation, if carried out by HMS, otherwise 
     after delivery. 
 
 5.5 Payments shall be effected without deductions within 
     thirty days after invoicing. Customer shall be in 
     default of payment after this period of time without 
     reminder.

 5.6 Duties, taxes and levies including VAT - if 
     applicable - shall be paid by Customer on all charges.

 5.7 Customer has no right of retention, in particular no 
     right to withhold payment. Customer may set off only 
     those sums owed by Contractor which are unappealable 
     or uncontested against sums owed by Customer.

 § 6 Framework Contracts
 
 6.1 When concluding a framework contract on the purchase 
     of a certain quantity of a product in a defined period of 
     time, the framework contract defines the quantity, the 
     period of time, the minimum quantity per delivery, and the 
     price per piece.

 6.2 When ordering a framework, the customer receives from 
     HMS an electronically produced framework contract. This 
     framework contract is valid without a signature. The 
     framework contract has to be checked immediately by the 
     customer for accuracy with any errors reported immediately. 
     A complaint by the customer must be made within 5 working 
     days of receipt of the framework contract.

 6.3 With acknowledgment of the framework contract, the 
     customer is obliged to fulfill the purchase of the quantity 
     of products defined in the framework contract within the 
     defined period of time.

 6.4 If the customer at the end of the defined period of 
     time has not purchased the entire agreed quantity, HMS 
     is entitled to deliver and invoice the outstanding 
     quantity of the product/ products.

 § 7 HMS's Claims, HMS's Delay

 7.1 In the event of any circumstances for which HMS 
     is not responsible, and which adversely affect the 
     performance of the contractual obligations, including
     strike and lock-out, HMS is entitled to an 
     appropriate adaptation of the terms of the contract, 
     in particular to an appropriate extension of the 
     delivery date. If the cause is attributable to 
     Customer and results in additional efforts to HMS, 
     HMS is also entitled to additional compensation. 

 § 8 Removal of Defects

 8.1 If Customer finds, in the course of correct use of the 
     programs, what Customer believes to be a defect in a 
     product, Customer shall provide HMS with reasonably 
     specific information as to the nature of the defect 
     and the conditions under which it occurs, in writing, 
     if so requested by HMS. 
     Customer is only entitled to raise claims if Customer 
     can reproduce the defect or demonstrate it by using 
     computer output. 
     Upon request, Customer shall give all necessary 
     support to HMS, and in particular provide a copy 
     of the relevant program being used when the defect 
     appeared. Customer shall provide testing time on 
     Customer's IT-system and install corrections delivered 
     by HMS.

 8.2 HMS shall, within a reasonable period of time and 
     at no cost to Customer, remove the defect, at HMS´s 
     choice, either by replacing the defective product or 
     by correction of defects (subsequent performance). 
     If a defect substantially restricts the use of an 
     application program, HMS shall provide a workaround 
     (temporary solution), if needed, so that the defect 
     is not substantial any longer. 
     HMS may deliver the correction of other defects 
     by delivering a new version as soon as is adequate 
     subject to a reasonable policy of further development. 
     HMS shall develop workarounds insofar as these are 
     technically and at acceptable costs to HMS feasible. 
     With respect to programs, which are defined as third 
     party programs, HMS can only use its best endeavors 
     to obtain and transfer corrective measures and, if 
     appropriate, provide workarounds.

 8.3 All claims against HMS shall be expressly excluded 
     for those products, which Customer modifies or 
     manipulates in any other way, unless Customer proves, 
     when reporting a defect, that the defect did not 
     result from any such modification or manipulation. 

 8.4 HMS is entitled to reimbursement of costs if Customer
     reports what Customer believes to be a defect without 
     being able to prove it to be so.

 § 9 HMS's Liability
     The legal provisions shall apply with the following 
     amendments:

 9.1 Defects shall be removed according to § 8. 

 9.2 HMS - including any person engaged in performing 
     any obligation under this contract - shall be liable 
     for damages under any claim based on normal negligence 
     only if HMS breaches a basic obligation under this 
     contract. In this event, HMS's liability shall be 
     restricted to the higher of the following amounts: 

     - EUR 100,000.00,
     - the contract value, or 
     - the characteristic and foreseeable damages.

     Customer is entitled to claim for a higher maximum, but 
     HMS may then require a surcharge for the aggravated risk. 
     
     The restrictions shall not apply to the extent the 
     damages are covered under HMS's business liability 
     insurance and provided the insurance company has 
     effected payment to HMS. HMS agrees to maintain 
     the coverage of the business liability insurance as 
     provided at the time of the execution of the contract.

     Claims for personal injury and claims based on the 
     German Product Liability Act shall remain untouched.

 9.3 If Customer is entitled to rescind the contract and/or 
     claim for damages, HMS is entitled to set a period 
     within which Customer must declare whether or not 
     Customer still requests primary or subsequent 
     performance. If Customer does not request primary or 
     subsequent performance timely, Customer cannot claim 
     for it any longer.

 9.4 The period of warranty (the limitation period for 
     claims based on defects) shall be 12 months. It 
     shall commence with installation, if carried out by 
     HMS, otherwise one month after delivery.

 § 10 Confidentiality

 10.1 HMS shall keep confidential Customer's trade and 
     business secrets, and all other information 
     designated in writing as confidential by Customer, 
     obtained under or in connection with this contract. 
     HMS shall have no obligation with respect to any 
     information that is already in its possession, is 
     independently developed or becomes publicly known 
     through no wrongful act of HMS. This obligation 
     shall survive the contract in the case of its 
     rescission.

 10.2 HMS is not obligated to keep confidential any 
     ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques related to 
     the development of software.

 10.3 HMS shall require its employees to adhere to the 
     obligations stipulated in § 10.1.

 10.4 HMS may enter Customer's name into its list of 
     customers together with a short description of the 
     HMS's performance.
     All other references that Customer is HMS's customer 
     are subject to Customer’s prior approval.

 § 11 Miscellaneous

 11.1 The contract shall constitute the entire agreement 
      between the parties and shall not be altered, 
      amended or cancelled, except in writing and with 
      the consent and signature of all parties concerned. 

 11.2 The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply 
      exclusively. The application of the United Nations 
      Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
      Goods (CISG) shall explicitly be excluded.
	  
 11.3 The place of jurisdiction for any dispute related to 
      the License Agreement, these contractual terms and the 
      services performed under the application thereof shall 
      be the corporate seat of the Licensor or, at the 
      Licensor's option, the Stuttgart Regional Court's 
      division having jurisdiction over IT or software matters
      or the court competent for the Customer's registered office.

     der zur Unternehmensgruppe des Kunden gehörenden 
     Unternehmen.

 2.2 Der Kunde darf die Software nur mit solcher Hardware 
     einsetzen, für die HMS diese freigegeben hat. Eine 
     Verwendung der Software mit Produkten, welche im direkten 
     Wettbewerb zu von HMS angebotenen und beworbenen IXXAT 
     Produkten stehen, ist explizit vom Nutzungsrecht 
     ausgeschlossen.

 2.3 Der Kunde darf das Benutzungsrecht je Software in 
     ausführbarer Form (Objektprogramme, nicht Quellprogramme) 
     an einen anderen Anwender weiterveräußern, wenn er auf die 
     Benutzung der Software verzichtet und der andere vor Erhalt 
     der Datenträger mit der Software durch Erklärung gegenüber 
     HMS sich zum Softwareschutz schriftlich verpflichtet und den
     vereinbarten Umfang des Benutzungsrechts an der Software 
     anerkennt.
     Explizit ausgenommen hiervon ist Software, welche von HMS 
     unentgeltlich - ob einzeln oder als Teil eines weiteren 
     Produktes - zur Integration von HMS Hardware und/oder HMS 
     Software in eine Kundenanwendung zur Verfügung stellt. 
     Diese Software darf vom Kunden an andere Anwender 
     weiterveräußert werden, solgange der Kunde dafür Sorge 
     trägt, dass der weitere Anwender an die Lizenzbedingungen 
     von HMS gebunden ist und vorhandene Copyright-Hinweise 
     nicht verändert oder entfernt werden. Beispiele für solche 
     Software sind die IXXAT VCI, IXXAT ECI und zugehörige 
     Beispielanwendungen.

 § 3 Leistungserbringung

 3.1 Auf Wunsch des Kunden installiert HMS Hardware 
     und Software vor Ort. In diesem Fall wird der 
     Kunde die Installationsvoraussetzungen rechtzeitig

     spätestens im Zeitpunkt der Installation 
     fachkundiges Bedienungspersonal zur Verfügung steht. 
     HMS wird das Netz vor Beginn der Installation auf 
     dessen Funktionsfähigkeit überprüfen. Der Kunde wird 
     den erfolgreichen Abschluss der Installation 
     schriftlich bestätigen.
     Die Installationsvoraussetzungen ergeben sich aus 
     den Richtlinien des jeweiligen Herstellers der 
     Hardware. HMS wird den Kunden auf Wunsch bei der 
     Schaffung der Installationsvoraussetzungen beraten.

 3.2 Es ist Sache des Kunden, die Software in Betrieb zu 
     nehmen. Dazu gehört auch, dass der Kunde diese unter 
     seinen Einsatzbedingungen überprüft, bevor er sie 
     produktiv einsetzt. HMS ist bereit, ihn auch dabei 
     auf Verlangen gegen Vergütung nach Aufwand zu 
     unterstützen.

 3.3 Der Kunde wird alle Leistungen von HMS unverzüglich 
     auf Fehlerfreiheit untersuchen, soweit das im 
     ordnungsgemäßen Geschäftsgang angebracht ist.

 3.4 Alle Unterstützungsleistungen (insb. Installation, 
     Einsatzvorbereitung und Demonstration der 
     Betriebsbereitschaft, Einweisung, Schulung oder 
     Beratung) werden gesondert nach Aufwand vergütet, 
     sofern nichts anderes vereinbart wird.

 3.5 HMS benennt einen Kundenberater, der Kunde einen 
     Ansprechpartner. Diese können Entscheidungen treffen 
     oder unverzüglich herbeiführen. Der Kundenberater 
     soll Entscheidungen schriftlich festhalten. Der

     Benutzerdokumentation und weiterer Unterlagen 
     - auch in künftigen Versionen - urheberrechtlich 
     geschützt und Betriebsgeheimnis von HMS oder des 
     jeweiligen Herstellers ist. Er trifft zeitlich 
     unbegrenzt Vorsorge, dass diese vor missbräuchlicher 
     Nutzung geschützt wird. 
     Soweit Quellprogramme geliefert werden, darf der 
     Kunde diese Dritten nur mit Zustimmung von HMS 
     zugänglich machen. Die Zustimmung darf nicht gegen 
     Treu und Glauben verweigert werden; sie braucht 
     nicht dafür gegeben zu werden, dass ein Dritter 
     die Pflege übernimmt.

 4.2 Der Kunde darf Vervielfältigungsstücke (Kopien) nur 
     zu Sicherungszwecken, als Ersatz oder - im Falle 
     der Lieferung von Quellprogrammen - zur Fehlersuche 
     erstellen. Der Vermerk auf dem gelieferten 
     Datenträger über Softwarebezeichung, Urheberrechtsinhaber 
     und Lieferant ist auch auf Datenträger mit Kopien

     gesetzlichen Mehrwertsteuer.

 5.7 Der Kunde ist - unbeschadet seines Rechts, Zahlungen 
     wegen unvollständiger oder fehlerhafter Leistung 
     seitens HMS zu verweigern - nicht befugt, 
     Zahlungen zurückzuhalten. Er kann nur mit 
     Forderungen aufrechnen, die rechtskräftig 
     festgestellt, entscheidungsreif oder die von HMS 
     anerkannt worden sind.

 § 6 Rahmenverträge

 6.1 Bei Abschluss eines Rahmenvertrags über die Abnahme 
     einer bestimmten Menge eines Produkts in einem definierten 
     Zeitraum wird in dem Rahmenvertrag die Menge, der 
     Abnahmezeitraum, die Mindestliefermenge pro Abruf sowie 
     der Preis pro Stück festgelegt.

 6.2 Bei Bestellung eines Rahmens erhält der Kunde von 
     HMS einen maschinell erstellen Rahmenvertrag. Dieser ist 
     ohne Unterschrift gültig. Der Rahmenvertrag ist vom Kunden 
     unverzüglich auf Richtigkeit zu prüfen und im Fall von 
     falschen Daten unverzüglich zu reklamieren. Eine Reklamation 
     durch den Kunden hat spätestens 5 Arbeitstage nach Zugang

     ausstehende Stückzahl des Produkts / der Produkte zu 
     liefern und in Rechnung zu stellen.

 § 7 Störungen bei der Leistungserbringung, Verzug

 7.1 Soweit eine Ursache, die HMS nicht zu vertreten 
     hat, einschließlich Streik oder Aussperrung, die 
     Termineinhaltung beeinträchtigt, kann HMS eine 
     angemessene Verschiebung der Termine verlangen. 
     Erhöht sich der Aufwand aufgrund einer Ursache im 
     Verantwortungsbereich des Kunden, kann HMS auch 
     die Vergütung des eigenen Mehraufwands verlangen.

 § 8 Vereinbarungen zur Mängelbeseitigung

 8.1 Treten bei vertragsmäßiger Benutzung Mängel auf, 
     hat der Kunde diese in nachvollziehbarer Form unter 
     Angabe der für die Mängelerkennung zweckdienlichen 
     Informationen zu melden, und zwar auf Verlangen von 
     HMS schriftlich. 
     Voraussetzung für alle Ansprüche gegen HMS ist, 
     dass der Mangel reproduzierbar ist oder durch 
     maschinell erzeugte Ausgaben aufgezeigt werden kann.
     Der Kunde hat HMS im Rahmen des Zumutbaren bei der 
     Beseitigung von Mängeln zu unterstützen, insb. 
     auf Wunsch von HMS die Software, wie diese bei 
     Auftreten des Mangels benutzt wurde, zu übersenden 
     und Maschinenzeit zur Verfügung zu stellen sowie 
     Korrekturmaßnahmen, die HMS bereitstellt, 
     einzuspielen.

 8.2 HMS erbringt die Nacherfüllung nach eigener Wahl 
     durch Mängelbeseitigung oder durch Ersatzlieferung 
     in angemessener Frist. HMS wird bei Mängeln, die 
     den Einsatz einer Software schwerwiegend 
     beeinträchtigen, bei Bedarf eine Umgehungslösung vor 
     der endgültigen Nacherfüllung bereitstellen. 
     HMS braucht andere Mängel erst zu dem Zeitpunkt 
     zu beseitigen, zu dem HMS das im Rahmen 
     sachgerechter Versionspflege einplant. HMS wird 
     auch für solche Mängel Umgehungslösungen 
     bereitstellen, soweit das für HMS zumutbar ist. 
     Bei Software, die ausdrücklich als solche von 
     Vorlieferanten gekennzeichnet ist, braucht HMS 
     das nur zu tun, soweit HMS dazu technisch in der 
     Lage ist und das HMS zu finanziell akzeptablen 
     Konditionen möglich ist. HMS wird aber 
     Korrekturmaßnahmen, die beim Vorlieferanten bereits 
     vorhanden sind, bereitstellen.

 8.3 Alle Ansprüche gegen HMS erlöschen für solche 
     Produkte, die der Kunde ändert oder in die er sonst 
     wie eingreift, es sei denn, dass der Kunde im 
     Zusammenhang mit der Mängelmeldung nachweist, dass 
     der Eingriff für den Mangel nicht ursächlich ist.

 8.4 HMS kann die Vergütung des eigenen Aufwands 
     verlangen, soweit HMS auf Grund einer 
     Mängelmeldung tätig geworden ist, ohne dass der 
     Kunde einen Mangel nachgewiesen hat.

 § 9 Haftung von HMS

 9.1 Kommt HMS mit der Erfüllung (durch Lieferung) bzw. 
     Nacherfüllung (durch Mängelbeseitigung oder 
     Ersatzlieferung) in Verzug, kann der Kunde eine 
     angemessene Frist für die Erfüllung oder die 
     Nacherfüllung setzen. Verstreicht die Frist 
     erfolglos oder schlägt die Erfüllung oder die 
     Nacherfüllung sonst wie endgültig fehl, kann der 
     Kunde seine gesetzlichen Ansprüche geltend machen, 
     Schadensersatz im Rahmen von § 9.3. HMS kann dem 
     Kunden eine angemessene Frist für die Erklärung 
     setzen, ob dieser noch Erfüllung/Nacherfüllung 
     verlangt. Nach erfolglosem Ablauf dieser 
     Erklärungsfrist ist der Anspruch des Kunden auf 
     Erfüllung/Nacherfüllung ausgeschlossen.

 9.2 Die Verjährungsfrist für Ansprüche wegen Mängeln 
     („Gewährleistungsfrist“) beträgt 12 Monate. 
 
 9.3 Schadensersatzansprüche - gleich aus welchem 
     Rechtsgrund - gegen HMS (einschl. deren 
     Erfüllungsgehilfen), die leichte Fahrlässigkeit 
     voraussetzen, bestehen nur, wenn eine wesentliche 
     Vertragspflicht/Kardinalpflicht verletzt worden ist. 

     Schadensersatzansprüche sind in diesem Fall auf den 
     höheren der folgenden Werte beschränkt:

     - EUR 100.000,00,
     - Auftragswert, oder 
     - auf den typischen und vorhersehbaren Schaden.

     Der Kunde kann eine weitergehende Haftung gegen Zahlung 
     eines Risikozuschlags verlangen.

     Die Einschränkungen gelten nicht, soweit die Schäden 
     durch die Betriebshaftpflichtversicherung von HMS 
     gedeckt sind und vorausgesetzt, der Versicherer hat an 
     HMS gezahlt. HMS verpflichtet sich, die bei 
     Vertragsabschluss bestehende Deckung aufrechtzuerhalten. 

     Ansprüche wegen Körperschäden sowie Ansprüche auf der 
     Grundlage des Produkthaftungsgesetzes bleiben unberührt.

 § 10 Vertraulichkeit

 10.1 HMS verpflichtet sich, alle im Rahmen des 
     Vertragsverhältnisses erlangten Kenntnisse von 
     Betriebs- und Geschäftsgeheimnissen und von 
     schriftlich als vertraulich bezeichneten 
     Informationen nur zur Durchführung des Vertrags 
     zu verwenden und zeitlich unbegrenzt vertraulich 
     zu behandeln.

 10.2 Die Verpflichtung zur vertraulichen Behandlung gilt 
     nicht für Ideen, Konzeptionen, Know-how und 
     Techniken, die sich auf Software-Erstellung beziehen, 
     sowie für Daten, die HMS bereits bekannt sind 
     oder außerhalb dieses Vertrages bekannt waren oder 
     bekannt werden.

 10.3 HMS verpflichtet ihre Mitarbeiter zur Wahrung der 
     Vertraulichkeit.

 10.4 HMS darf den Namen des Kunden und eine 
     Kurzbeschreibung der erbrachten Leistung in eine 
     Referenzliste aufnehmen. Alle anderen Werbehinweise 
     auf den Kunden werden vorab mit ihm abgesprochen.

 § 11 Schriftform, Gerichtsstand

 11.1 Der Vertrag und seine Änderungen bedürfen der 
      Schriftform.

 11.2 Es gilt ausschließlich das Recht der Bundesrepublik
      Deutschland. Die Anwendung des UN-Kaufrechts (CISG)
      wird ausdrücklich ausgeschlossen.
	  
 11.3 Gerichtsstand für alle Streitigkeiten, die mit dem
      Lizenzvertrag, diesen Vertragsbedingungen und den 
      unter ihrer Geltung vorgenommenen Leistungen 
      zusammenhängen, ist der Sitz des Lizenzgebers oder
      nach dessen Wahl die für IT- bzw. Software-
      Angelegenheiten zuständige Kammer des Landgerichts 
      Stuttgart oder das für den Sitz des Kunden 
      zuständige Gericht.
